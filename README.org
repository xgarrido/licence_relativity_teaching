* Introduction

This repository contains materials for Special Relativity classes given in Licence 3 of Fundamental
Physics at the University of Paris Sud.

* Installation

You will need special =orgmode= settings to translate the =org= files into =pdf= documents. All the needed
code is embedded within this file in the next sections. Nevertheless, you will need to install some
[[https://github.com/xgarrido/latex-templates][latex-templates]] specially developed for such purpose.

Moreover, to avoid duplication of =org-mode= LaTeX class, [[https://github.com/xgarrido/zsh-org-pages][org-pages]] script is used to produce =pdf= file
as well as =html= (if needed). It adds another dependency but it eases the unification of org export
for several file sources.

There is no need to detangle this file since emacs will do it when you will use the Makefile in the
corresponding directories. So, next step will be to do =make= within the different directories.

* Browsing classes
